# Week 2

This week I started learning about Neural Networks. Before this, I had heard terms like deep learning and neural networks many times but I never knew what they actually meant. This week helped me understand the basic idea behind how these models learn.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a collection of small units called neurons that are connected together. These neurons take some input, perform calculations and pass the result to the next layer.

A simple neural network usually has three types of layers:

- Input Layer
- Hidden Layer(s)
- Output Layer

```
Input → Hidden Layer → Output
```

The hidden layers are where most of the learning happens.

## Perceptron

The perceptron is the simplest type of neuron.

It takes multiple inputs, multiplies them with weights, adds a bias and produces an output.

```
Output = Activation(Inputs × Weights + Bias)
```

I didn't focus too much on the mathematical derivation, but I understood that weights decide how important each input is.

---

## Weights and Bias

Weights control how much influence each input has on the output.

Bias is an extra value that helps shift the output if needed.

During training, both the weights and bias are updated so that the model makes better predictions.

---

## Activation Functions

At first I thought neurons only performed multiplication and addition. Then I learned about activation functions.

Activation functions help the network learn more complex patterns. Without them, even a very deep network would behave like a simple linear model.

Some activation functions that I came across were:

- ReLU
- Sigmoid
- Tanh

ReLU seemed to be the most commonly used one.

---

## Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process where the input moves through the network until the final prediction is produced.

```
Input
   ↓
Hidden Layer
   ↓
Output
```

At this stage, the model simply makes a prediction. It doesn't know whether the prediction is correct or not.

---

## Loss Function

After making a prediction, the model compares it with the correct answer.

The difference between them is measured using a loss function.

If the prediction is close to the correct answer, the loss will be small.

If the prediction is very different, the loss will be larger.

The main goal during training is to reduce this loss.

---

## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is the method used to reduce the loss.

Instead of changing the weights randomly, the model updates them in a direction that decreases the error.

I understood the basic idea, but I still need to study how the gradients are actually calculated.

---

## Backpropagation

This was probably the most difficult topic for me this week.

Backpropagation is the process of sending the error backwards through the network.

The gradients are calculated and the weights are updated.

Although I understood the overall idea, I still need to spend more time on the mathematical part.

---

## What I Learned

This week helped me understand how a neural network learns from its mistakes.

The complete process is roughly:

```
Input
   ↓
Prediction
   ↓
Calculate Loss
   ↓
Backpropagation
   ↓
Update Weights
```

This process is repeated many times until the model starts making better predictions.

## My Notes

I found this week more challenging than Week 1 because it involved more mathematics.

Even though I don't fully understand all the equations yet, I now have a basic idea of how neural networks learn. I think this foundation will be useful when studying transformers and language models in the coming weeks.
