# Week 1

This week was mainly about revising Python and learning a few libraries that will be useful later in the project. I had already used Python before, so this was mostly a refresher.

I revised basic Python concepts and then explored NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

### NumPy

NumPy is used for numerical computations. It provides arrays that are much faster than normal Python lists. I learned basic operations like creating arrays, indexing, reshaping and matrix multiplication.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)
```

### Pandas

Pandas is useful for working with datasets. I learned how to read CSV files, access rows and columns and perform some simple operations.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(data.head())
```

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is used to plot graphs. I tried simple line plots and bar graphs. It makes it easier to understand data visually.

## Introduction to LLMs

This week I also got introduced to Large Language Models.

Before this, I only knew that ChatGPT is an AI model. I never thought about how it actually generates text.

The main idea I learned is that an LLM predicts **one token at a time**.

For example,

```
I am going to
```

the next prediction could be

```
school
```

After predicting one token, the model again predicts the next one. This continues until the sentence is complete.

One thing that surprised me was how simple the overall idea is. The difficult part is building a model that can make good predictions.

I also learned what a token is. A token is a small piece of text. Sometimes it is a complete word and sometimes it is only part of a word.

For example,

```
playing
```

may be split into

```
play
ing
```

depending on the tokenizer.

### My Notes

This week gave me a basic idea of how language models work. I still don't know how the model decides which token is the most likely, but I think that will become clearer in the next few weeks.
